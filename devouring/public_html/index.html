                    <div class="sub-disc">
                        <p>Sometimes you can intend a desired situation, or be as positive as you can or you can say affirmations till you’re blue in the face and no change happens in your life. Often, it’s not as simple as those book authors say.</p>
                        <p>After studying many psychic sciences I decided that the way to find out the truth behind my situation was in the Akashic Records.  I had a reading and discovered a block and a restriction that were holding me back since 21 lifetimes ago. Now that I know what’s been holding me back, I can change my thinking patterns so that situation doesn’t recur. There’s a lot less drama in my life now.</p>
                        <p>So if things seem out of control and you don’t know where to turn to, I invite you to have an Akashic Records Reading with a certified practitioner. I am such a person and I can reveal not only your Soul Profile, but the particular blocks and restrictions at soul-level that are keeping you misaligned from your Divine Source to that you can truly have an abundant life as well as peace and joy in your heart.</p>
                        <p>Your investment for such a reading is $200 for the research, presentation and 1-hour delivery of your Akashic Records. I will answer your questions, send you a taped copy of the reading and give you a short homework to repeat 21 days to keep your mind from sliding back into its prior pattern of thinking.</p>
                        <p>You’ll be surprised at the amazing amount of information that is available to you through your Akashic Records and how they will point to those soul-level blocks and restrictions that are currently limiting your life</p>
                        <p>So if you’d like to know more please email me at linda@devouringmoon.com . If you decide to try it, please tell me what you hope to accomplish in the next six months of your life. Your questions can be on anything you want the Akashic Records to uncover whether it be finances, health, romance, work or business  or friends  and family.</p>
                        <p>Information I’ll need from you is :</p>
                        <ul>
